# GitHub Security Setup Guide

This guide helps you enable additional security features for your repository.

## Current Security Features ✅

Your repository already includes:
- ✅ Automated security audits (daily)
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Pull request security checks
- ✅ Socket.dev integration ready
- ✅ Zero known vulnerabilities

## Optional: Enable GitHub Advanced Security

For private repositories, you can enable additional security features:

### 1. Enable Dependency Graph
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Security & analysis"
3. Enable "Dependency graph"

### 2. Enable GitHub Advanced Security (Private repos only)
1. In the same "Security & analysis" section
2. Enable "GitHub Advanced Security"
3. This enables:
   - Advanced dependency review
   - Code scanning alerts
   - Secret scanning

### 3. Enhanced Workflow (Optional)
If you enable GitHub Advanced Security, you can replace the current dependency-review job with:

```yaml
dependency-review:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  
  steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
  - name: Dependency Review
    uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v4
    with:
      fail-on-severity: moderate
      allow-licenses: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC
```

## Current Workflow Benefits

Even without GitHub Advanced Security, your current setup provides:
- **Daily Security Audits**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **PR Security Checks**: Every pull request is security-tested
- **Dependency Validation**: Package integrity verification
- **Zero Vulnerabilities**: Confirmed clean dependency tree

## Socket.dev Integration

To enable Socket.dev monitoring:
1. Visit [Socket.dev](https://socket.dev)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. The `socket.yml` configuration is already in place

## Questions?

If you need help with security setup, please:
- Check our [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md)
- Open an issue in the repository
- Contact the maintainers

**Note**: The current security workflow works perfectly for both public and private repositories without requiring GitHub Advanced Security.
